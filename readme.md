# Nvim Configs
My personal nvim config. It's an eternal work in progress where I'm never satisfied... Help

## Depedencies that I could remeber
This section describes indirect depencies that cannot be installed with lazy. But with apt, go install, rustup, etc.

```bash
# bun (Seems to install npm/node together???)
curl -fsSL https:#bun.sh/install | bash

# fd
sudo apt install fd-find

# ripgrep
sudo apt install ripgrep

# glow
go install github.com/charmbracelet/glow@latest

# neovide
cargo install --git https:#github.com/neovide/neovide
```
